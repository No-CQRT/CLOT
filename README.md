## Curated List of Tools

This is another "just for fun" project: the idea is to use GitHub as a platform for microblogging/bookmark site.
It work in a very simple way: the "issues" are the blog content; just add a new issue with a label, and the project github page will render it in a HYML page (with some JS, CSS and magic) including search, pagination and select by category. 

## Main features
- Simple to use and mantain (just post a issue, web backed is included in github)
- Issues can be also viewed/searched with the GH cli command
- You can style it in different ways (actually like "HN" CSS)

## Coming soon
a simple TUI for navigating and search post via CLI (bash)
